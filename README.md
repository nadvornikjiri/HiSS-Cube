# HiSS-Cube
Authors: Nadvornik Jiri, Skoda Petr, Tvrdik Pavel
Software package for processing astronomical photometric and spectroscopic Hierarchical Semi-Sparse data within HDF5. Can be extended to any kind of multidimensional data combination and information retrieval.

The whole framework and its usage are described in detail in the [Astronomy&Computing article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350585859_HiSS-Cube_A_scalable_framework_for_Hierarchical_Semi-Sparse_Cubes_preserving_uncertainties), while the parallel version is described in this [IEEE Xplore article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278401). Dissertation Thesis based on this software can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14884443).

## Installation instructions

1. Installing dependencies
```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3-pip libbz2-dev libsm6 libfontconfig1 libxrender1 libopenmpi-dev ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6
```

### Development version - parallel implementation with MPIO
1. Download h5py and hdf5 into ext_lib folder within the SDSSCube git folder. 
  1. ```mkdir h5py && cd h5py && git clone https://github.com/h5py/h5py.git . ```
  2. Latest tar release of HDF5 from here: https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/source-code/.
2. Build & Install HDF5 parallel
```
./configure --enable-build-mode=debug --enable-parallel --enable-codestack
make -j8
make install
```
3. Build & Install h5py
```
export CC=mpicc
export HDF5_MPI="ON"
export HDF5_DIR=~/SDSSCube/ext_lib/hdf5-1.12.1/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/SDSSCube/ext_lib/hdf5-1.12.1/hdf5/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
python setup_configure.py --mpi
pip uninstall h5py
python setup.py install
```

2. Download code
```bash
mkdir SDSSCube
cd SDSSCube
git clone https://github.com/nadvornikjiri/HiSS-Cube.git .
```
4.Create virtual environment
```bash
pip3 install virtualenv
python3 -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```




## Download data from Zenodo
Download the "data.tar.gz" from [Zenodo HiSS Cube](https://zenodo.org/record/4273993#.X8ESdWhKiUk) and extract the contentse Ã¬nside the git repository. The "data" folder should afterwards contain "galaxy_small", "images", "spectra", etc. All of the tests in the scripts/tests folder will pass afterwards and the Ipython notebook pre-set paths will work as well.


## Running the IPython notebook

1. Run the IPython notebook
```bash
jupyterlab
````

2. Open the SDSS Cube.ipynb file.
3. Run all of the cells.
4. The output HiSS-Cube file is produced in the last cell at the specified output path, default is results/SDSS_Cube.h5.

More information about the notebooks is documented in the notebooks/Readme file.

# The IPython notebooks in this folder are documentation for separate HiSS-Cube areas.

1. SDSS_cube.ipynb - Overall documentation of the preprocessing phase of HiSS-Cube. Essentially describes in detail what happens in `hisscube.py create`.
2. h5web.ipynb - Showcase of the H5Web viewer with the created HiSS-Cube file. Run the previous notebook first to create the file or create it yourself.
3. ml_testing.ipynb - Shows how to work with the 3D cube (image, spectral axes, with temporal axis aggregated), created in the `ml-cube` subcommand of `hisscube.py update`.
4. SNR tests.ipynb - Shows how to import the Star formation rate data into HiSS-Cube and work with it in combination with the 3D cube from `ml-cube` step.
